# Lurk
Lurk is a simple CLI tool that checks product stock across multiple stores. Search by keywords, set filters like price or category, and get real-time availabilityâ€”all without leaving your terminal.

Built with Python, it leverages asynchronous requests for speed and efficiency. Data fetching is handled via custom store-specific checkers, and results are structured using Pydantic models.
